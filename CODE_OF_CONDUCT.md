# ðŸ“œ Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of this project want to create an open, respectful, and inclusive environment for everyone â€” regardless of level of experience, identity, or background.

Weâ€™re here to learn, share, and grow â€” with kindness.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate in communication
- Welcoming different viewpoints and constructive feedback
- Showing empathy and kindness to others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment or discrimination of any kind
- Personal attacks or insults
- Trolling, disruptive behavior, or unconstructive criticism

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces â€” including issues, pull requests, discussions, and community platforms â€” as well as in public spaces when someone is representing the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive or unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue (if public resolution is appropriate), or privately by contacting the maintainer directly.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and appropriate action will be taken.
